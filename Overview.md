# A Nordic Theme and Preference Pack

This pack contains a dark and a light theme to fit the [Nord](https://nordtheme.com) colour palette as well as a set of preferences.  
Preferences activate and group panels and arrange workbeches. Themes and preferences work independently, you can use either or both.

After installation you can select and apply your preferred theme NorthernLights or NorthernNights within `Preferences > General`.  
Be aware that applying the NordicPreferences alters your UI arrangement, make sure to back up current settings when in doubt.
